[1mNAME[0m
       geoip - a tool to show geographical data based on hostname or IP
       address(es)

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
        geoip --help

        geoip --fetch [--no-update]

        geoip [options] host|IP ...

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       This tool uses a database to use the (pre-fetched) GeoIP2 data from
       MaxMind to show related geographical information for IP addresses. This
       information can optionally be extended with information from online
       WHOIS services and or derived data, like distance to the location of
       the server this tool runs on or a configured local location.

       The output is plain text or JSON. JSON may be short or formatted.

   [1mConfiguration[0m
       The tool allows the use of configuration files. It tests for existence
       of the files listed here. All existing files is read (in this order) if
       it is only writable by the author (mode 0640 should do).

          $home/geoip.rc
          $home/.geoiprc
          $home/.config/geoip

       where $home is either of $HOME, $USERPROFILE, or $HOMEPATH.

       The format of the file is

         # Comment
         ; Comment
         option : value
         option = value

       where the ":" and "=" are equal and whitespace around them is optional
       and ignored. The values "False" and "No" (case insensitive) are the
       same as 0 and the values "True" and "Yes" are equal to 1. For
       readability you can prefix "use_" to most options (it is ignored). The
       use of "-" in option names is allowed and will be translated to "_".

       The recognized options and the command line equivalences are

       fetch
         command line option : "-f" or "--fetch"

         default value       : False

         Fetch new databases from the MaxMind site.

       update
         command line option : "-u" or "--update"

         default value       : True

         Only in effect when used with "--fetch": when new data files from
         MaxMind have successfully been fetched and any of these is newer that
         what the database contains, update the database with the new data.

       distance
         command line option : "-d" or "--distance"

         default value       : False

         If both the location of the tool [4mand[24m the location of the requested IP
         are known, calculate the distance between them. The default is to
         show the distance in kilometers. Choosing a configuration of "miles"
         instead of "True", "Yes", or 1 will show the distance in miles. There
         is no command line option for miles.

         The location of the tool is either locally stored in your
         configuration (see "--local-location") or fetched using the result of
         the urls "iplocation.com" <https://iplocation.com> or "geoiptool"
         <https://geoiptool.com>. This will - of course - not work if there is
         no network connection or outside traffic is not allowed.

       whois
         command line option : "-w" or "--whois"

         default value       : False

         If Net::Whois::IP is installed, and this option is true, this module
         will be used to retrieve the "whois" information. This will not work
         if there is no network connection or outside traffic is not allowed.

       short
         command line option : "-s" or "--short"

         default value       : False

         This option will disable the output of less-informative information
         like location, EU-membership, satellite and proxy. This option, if
         True, will also implicitly disable the "distance" and "whois"
         information.

       dsn
         command line option : "-Ddsn" or "--DB=dsn"

         default value       : $ENV{EOIP_DBI_DSN} or "dbi:Pg:geoip"

         See "DATABASE" for the (documented) list of supported database types.

         If the connection works, the tables used by this tool will be created
         if not yet present.

         The order of usage is:

         1.
           Command line argument ("--DB=dsn")

         2.
           The "GEOIP_DBI_DSN" environment variable

         3.
           The value for "dsn" in the configuration file(s)

         4.
           "dbi:Pg:dbname=geoip"

       json
         command line option : "-j" or "--json"

         default value       : False

         The default output for the information is plain text. With this
         option, the output will be in JSON format. The default is not
         prettified.

       json-pretty
         command line option : "-J" or "--json-pretty"

         default value       : False

         If set from the command-line, this implies the "--json" option.

         With this option, JSON output is done [4mpretty[24m (indented).

       local-location
         command line option : "-l lat/lon" or "--local=lat/lon"

         default value       : Undefined

         Sets the local location coordinates for use with distances.

         When running the tool from a different location than where the IP
         access is to be analyzed for or when the network connection will not
         report a location that would make sense (like working from a cloud or
         running over one or more VPN connections), one can set the location
         of the base in decimal notation.  (degree-minute-second-notation is
         not yet supported).

         This is also useful when there is no outbound connection possible or
         when you do not move location and you want to restrict network
         requests.

         The notation is decimal (with a ".", no localization support) where
         latitude and longitude are separated by a "/" or a ",", like "-l
         12.345678/-9.876543" or "--local=12,3456,45,6789".

       maxmind-account
         command line option : none

         default value       : Undefined

         Currently not (yet) used. Documentation only.

       license-id
         command line option : none

         default value       : Undefined

         Currently not (yet) used. Documentation only.

       license-key
         command line option : none

         default value       : Undefined

         As downloads are only allowed/possible using a valid MaxMind account,
         you need to provide a valid license key in your configuration file.

[1mDATABASE[0m
       Currently PostgreSQL and SQLite have been tested, but others may (or
       may not) work just as well. YMMV. Note that the database need to know
       the "CIDR" field type and is able to put a primary key on it.

       MariaDB and MySQL are not supported, as they do not support the concept
       of CIDR type fields.

       The advantage of PostgreSQL over SQLite is that you can use it with
       multiple users at the same time, and that you can share the database
       with other hosts on the same network behind a firewall.

       The advantage of SQLite over PostgreSQL is that it is a single file
       that you can copy or move to your liking. This file will be somewhere
       around 500 Mb.

       name of the country and the continent. As the country name is just a
       perl regex, you can select all countries with ".", or all countries
       that start with a "V":

[1mTODO[0m
       IPv6
         The ZIP files also contain IPv6 information, but it is not (yet)
         converted to the database, nor supported in analysis.

       Modularization
         Split up the different parts of the script to modules: fetch,
         extract, check, database, external tools, reporting.

       CPAN
         Turn this into something like App::geoip, complete with Makefile.PL
